## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

This project made a difference in my html - css abilities since it's a big project with a lot of sections, that made me search a lot for new stuff to learn.

### Continued development

I will start getting some more information about (display: grid) property and make sure i will master it, since it's so usefull and can skip a lot of time.
